Scripts
=======
new in version 1.6, there are a collection of useful scripts that can be used to
download and process data. The scripts are included in the package if downloaded with pypi,
but can also be downloaded and run individually from the `github repo <https://github.com/Ocean-Data-Lab/ooipy/tree/master/ooipy/scripts/>`_.
