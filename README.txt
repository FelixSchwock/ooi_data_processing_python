ooi_data_processing_library.py contains functions for processing and visualizing the
hydrophone data from the OOI. In the current version, the library, while being far from
exhaustive, contains basic functions for loading acoustic data and computing and plotting
spectrograms and power spectral density (PSD) estimates. It also provides functions for
computing spectrograms and PSD estimates using Pythons multiprocessing library to handle
large amounts of acoustic data.

An obspy environment must be installed in order to use the library.

The demo.ipynb provides examples on how to use the functions in the library.
